# Task: Playtest single-disc-on-csr v0.2.5 (fixes 2nd WHITE2 #643 movie hang)

## Why

You reported field 643 (WHITE2) didn't load at all on the v0.2.4 build.
Root cause: WHITE2 has **two independent** script slots that each try
to play a field movie. v0.2.4 only fixed one of them (`mdir` slot 31).
The other (`cl` slot 31 — CSR Disc 2's longer Cosmo Canyon cutscene
script, which also carries a CSR story edit) still had its own
`PMVIE`/`MOVIE` pair, and that movie ID doesn't resolve to a valid
stream on the single-disc build either — so the field hung on load
exactly like before.

Fix: strip only the `PMVIE`/`MOVIE` opcodes from `cl` slot 31, keeping
every other opcode (including CSR's story edit) untouched. Verified
directly against the actual builder pipeline (pristine D1 + CSR base +
this layer) that WHITE2 now has zero `PMVIE`/`MOVIE` opcodes anywhere.

Bumped to **v0.2.5**. This is a fresh playtest — confirm WHITE2 now
loads and plays correctly, and that everything from v0.2.4 still holds.

The build isn't committed (`.bin`/`.cue` gitignored) — rebuilt locally
below.

## Prerequisites

- `workspace/pristine/FINALFANTASY7_D1.bin`, `_D2.bin`, `_D3.bin` present.
- `Final-Fantasy-7-CSR` repo checked out as a sibling of this repo.
- Python 3 on PATH; run all commands from this repo's root.

## What you do

1. `git pull --ff-only`.
2. Rebuild the work bin and a matching `.cue`:

   ```bash
   python3 mods/single-disc/scripts/build_work_bin.py -o workspace/iso-extract/single-disc-v025-repro.bin
   printf 'FILE "single-disc-v025-repro.bin" BINARY\n  TRACK 01 MODE2/2352\n    INDEX 01 00:00:00\n' > workspace/iso-extract/single-disc-v025-repro.cue
   ```

   Expect two lines during the "Fixing WHITE2 movie hang" step: one for
   `mdir/31` (IFSW/PMVIE/JMPF/PMVIE/MOVIE block removed) and one for
   `cl/31` (PMVIE/MOVIE opcodes removed). No `WARNING:` or uncaught
   errors.

3. Open `workspace/iso-extract/single-disc-v025-repro.cue` in
   DuckStation fresh (no save states, no cheats).
4. New game, play through Midgar to confirm baseline sanity (no hangs).
5. Progress to the Disc 1→2 transition (BLACKBGB field #103 → LOST2 →
   break scene → COS_BTM2). Confirm it still goes straight to the break
   scene with music, and LOST2's background still renders correctly
   (unchanged from v0.2.3/v0.2.4).
6. Reach Cosmo Canyon and enter WHITE2. Confirm the field now loads at
   all (previously it didn't load), and that any cutscene/character
   moment there plays through without freezing or glitching.
7. Open this bin in Makou Reactor, make a trivial edit, Save. Confirm
   it still succeeds (should be unchanged from v0.2.3/v0.2.4).

## Evidence (paste)

```
Disc 1->2 transition: straight to break scene with music (expected)
LOST2 background: renders correctly (expected)
WHITE2: loads and plays through normally (fixed) / still hangs or glitches (bug)
Makou save test: SUCCEEDED / FAILED (paste exact text)
notes:
```

## When done

Paste evidence above, commit this file, push, say check.
